TODO for Devidify 1.14
==== === ======== ====

- fix frightfully ugly lame output display
- disallow mp3 encoding if lame is missing
- disallow ogg encoding if oggenc is missing
- don't write the rcfile on close every time
- url_hook should get the preferred browser from Gnome settings
- perhaps switch from rcfile to gconf
- use dbus to know whether there's a disc/dvd available/inserted/etc
- use gstreamer to do the hard work instead of simple shell commands
- replace lsdvd with something that can read evil Sony ARccOS discs
